# MusicTechHistorySimulation

For this simulation project, we elected to focus our attention towards Steve Reich's piece "Electric Counterpoint". We wanted to capture the minimalist aesthetic of the piece in an interactive way. The index.html file is the heart of the program. To create this small web application, we used tone.js. The instrument sounds used are from the package instruments.js, and each of the instrumental lines is a looped measure from "Electric Counterpoint" that we hardcoded into the program. By clicking the start and stop buttons for each of the guitars and basses, the user can isolate different instruments and see how each of the individual parts fits into the arrangement.
